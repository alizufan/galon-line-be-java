# Galon-Line BE Java
POC for Java Spring Boot ☕🌱 + Grafana Loki 📊 + Open Tracing 🔍 + SigNoz 📈 + Docker 🐳.

# Specification
- Maven
- Docker
- SigNoz
- Pickle (Pkl)
- Grafana Loki
- Open Telemetry
- Spring Boot v2.7.3

# Objective
My hope making this is to make the service have Observability, Maintainability and Scalability capabilities.
This is used to help understand the performance of a process in a service, so that it is easier to analyze the deficiencies in the service when it is used.

# Problems
- Forgot a configuration rules.
- Debug manual when api take so-much time.
- Debug manual when api crash or errors.
- Debug manual resource check cpu, memory.
  
# Questions
- How to centralize my configuration and make it alive and more expresive?
- How to keep track flow request on each process and sub-process?
- How to centralize a logs error and find it easily?
