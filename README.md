## Objective
My objective is to make a service have **Observability**, **Maintainability** and **Scalability** capabilities.
This is used to help understand a performance issue, logging, error / crash tracking a process in a service, so that can make us easier to analyze the deficiencies in the service when it is used.

## Problems
